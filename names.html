                Here are your Kojima names:
            </p>
            <section>
                <h2>NORMAL NAME</h2>
                <p id="normal-name" class="name"></p>
                <p class="note">
                    Kojima's early work includes lots of characters that have names that
                    are widely considered to be "normal". Was this just because, in the
                    early years, he didn't have the power to say, "I'm Hideo Kojima, I
                    can name someone Die-Hardman if I want to" without people
                    questioning him? Probably.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>OCCUPATIONAL NAME</h2>
                <p id="occupational-name" class="name"></p>
                <p class="note">
                    Kojima's characters tend to be driven by the work that they do. That
                    often carries over to their names. You, too, can be nothing more
                    than your job.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>HORNY NAME</h2>
                <p id="horny-name" class="name"></p>
                <p class="note">
                    Kojima's characters and stories are irrevocably horny. Weirdly
                    horny, sure, but horny nonetheless.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>THE NAME</h2>
                <p id="the-name" class="name"></p>
                <p class="note">
                    Kojima loves to make people have names that start with the word
                    "The" and they usually symbolize fears or unstoppable forces. You
                    are now that unstoppable force.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>COOL NAME</h2>
                <p id="cool-name" class="name"></p>
                <p class="note">
                    Kojima loves to be cool. Sometimes, his idea of cool is a bit
                    strange, but it is always cool to Hideo Kojima, and that's what
                    matters.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>VIOLENT NAME</h2>
                <p id="violent-name" class="name"></p>
                <p class="note">
                    Sometimes, a Kojima name can be very threatening and violent, like
                    Sniper Wolf, or The Fury. Now you can also be threatening and
                    violent.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>NAME THAT LACKS SUBTEXT</h2>
                <p id="name-that-lacks-subtext" class="name"></p>
                <p class="note">
                    Sometimes, Kojima gives up and just names a character exactly what
                    they are. Congratulations. You are exactly what you do.
